<h3>Project Overview</h3>\
\
In this file you can find some small practice project I completed during my learning phase(Via Datacamp, coursera etc).  
  
<b>First project: Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing.</b>  
In 1847 Dr. Semmelweis discovered that contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives. In this project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected and statistically prove that handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval.
