## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing" project.

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
In this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected. This project assumes that you are familiar with python and pandas DataFrames. You can learn the required skills in these courses:
* Intermediate Python for Data Science
* pandas Foundations


Along with exploring Dataset, we would also use matplotlib for the ploting some graph plot, so that we can see the results visually and find insights from it!

## Project Instructions
* Python 3.7
* Used jupyter-notebook
* Install pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib(if not installed)
